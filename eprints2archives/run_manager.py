# Class definitions.
# .............................................................................
# This class abstracts away the details of starting both a worker thread and
# the user interface.  The latter typically involves starting a GUI
# interface, although those details are abstracted out to a separate UI class.
#
# The basic problem that this faces is that on macOS, the wx main loop cannot
# be started in a subthread: it must be started in the main thread.  However,
# the wx MainLoop() call is a blocking call, so as soon as we invoke it
# (whether directly or via the ui.start() call as done below), nothing further
# happens in the current thread until the wx app thread exits.  This prevents
# us from doing what would make the most sense, which is to use a subthread
# to start the wx MainLoop() so that we don't block, and can instead wait for
# the worker thread to finish.
