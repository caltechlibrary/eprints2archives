    '''eprints2archives sends EPrints content to web archiving services.

One way to improve preservation and distribution of EPrints server content is
to ask web archiving sites such as the Internet Archive to store copies of the
public EPrints web pages.  Eprints2archives is a self-contained program for
doing just that.  It contacts a given EPrints server, obtains the list of
documents it serves (optionally modified based on selectors such as date),
determines the URLs for the document pages on the EPrints server, and sends
the URLs to archiving sites.

Specifying which EPrints server to contact
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This program contacts an EPrints REST server whose network API is accessible
at the URL given by the command-line option -a (or /a on Windows). A typical
EPrints server URL has the form "https://server.institution.edu/rest". This
program will automatically add "/eprint" to the URL path, so when writing the
URL after option -a, omit the trailing "/eprint" part of the URL.

Accessing some EPrints servers via the API requires supplying a user login and
password to the server. By default, this program uses the operating system's
keyring/keychain functionality to get a user name and password. If the
information does not exist from a previous run of eprints2archives, it will
ask the user interactively for the user name and password, and (unless the -K
or /K argument is given) store them in the user's keyring/keychain so that it
does not have to ask again in the future. It is also possible to supply the
information directly on the command line using the -u and -p options (or /u
and /p on Windows), but this is discouraged because it is insecure on
multiuser computer systems. (However, if you need to reset the user name and/or
password for some reason, use -u with a user name and let it prompt for a
password again.)  If a given EPrints server does not require a user name and
password, do not use -u or -p and supply blank values when prompted for them
by eprints2archives. (Empty user name and password are allowed values.)

Specifying which records to send
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The EPrints records to be sent to the web archiving services will be limited to
the records indicated by the option -i (or /i on Windows). If no -i option is
given, this program will use all the records available at the given EPrints
server. The value of -i can be one or more integers separated by commas
(e.g., -i 54602,54604), or a range of numbers separated by a dash (e.g.,
-i 1-100, which is interpreted as the list of numbers 1, 2, ..., 100 inclusive),
or some combination thereof. The value of the option -i can also be a file, in
which case, the file is read to get a list of identifiers. Note that if you use
the -i option, you may also want to use the -k option described below.

If the -l option (or /l on Windows) is given, the records will be additionally
filtered to return only those whose last-modified date/time stamp is no older
than the given date/time description. Valid descriptors are those accepted
by the Python dateparser library. Make sure to enclose descriptions within
single or double quotes. Examples:

  eprints2archives -l "2 weeks ago" -a ....
  eprints2archives -l "2014-08-29"  -a ....
  eprints2archives -l "12 Dec 2014" -a ....
  eprints2archives -l "July 4, 2013" -a ....

If the -s option (or /s on Windows) is given, the records will also be filtered
to include only those whose eprint_status element value is one of the listed
status codes. Comparisons are done in a case-insensitive manner. Putting a
caret character ("^") in front of the status (or status list) negates the
sense, so that eprints2archives will only keep those records whose eprint_status
value is *not* among those given. Examples:

  eprints2archives -s archive -a ...
  eprints2archives -s ^inbox,buffer,deletion -a ...

Both lastmod and status filering are done after the -i argument is processed.

By default, if an error occurs when requesting a record from the EPrints
server, eprints2archives will stop execution. Common causes of errors include
missing records implied by the arguments to -i, missing files associated with
a given record, and files inaccessible due to permissions errors. If the
option -k (or /k on Windows) is given, eprints2archives will attempt to keep
going upon encountering missing records, or missing files within records, or
similar errors. Option -k is particularly useful when giving a range of numbers
with the -i option, as it is common for EPrints records to be updated or deleted
and gaps to be left in the numbering. (Running without -i will skip over gaps
in the numbering because the available record numbers will be obtained directly
from the server, which is unlike the user providing a list of record numbers
that may or may not exist on the server. However, even without -i, errors may
still result from permissions errors or other causes.)

Specifying where to send records
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Eprints2archives has a set of built-in adapters to interact with a number of
known public web archiving services. To learn which services eprints2archives
knows about, use the option -S (or /S on Windows). By default, the program will
send EPrints record URLs to all the known services. The option -d (or /d on
Windows) can be used to select one or a list of destination services instead.
Lists of services should be separated by commas with no spaces between them;
e.g., "internetarchive,archivetoday".

By default, eprints2archives will only ask a service to archive a copy of an
EPrints record if the service does not already have an archived copy.  This
makes sense because EPrints records usually change infrequently, and there's
little point in repeatedly asking web archives to make new archives.  However,
if you have reason to want the web archives to re-archive EPrints records, you
can use the option -f (or /f on Windows).

Eprints2archives will use parallel process threads to query the EPrints server
as well as to send records to archiving services.  By default, the maximum
number of threads used is equal to 1/2 of the number of cores on the computer
it is running on. The option -t (or /t on Windows) can be used to change this
number.  Eprints2archives will always use only one thread per web archiving
service (and since there are only a few services, only a few threads are usable
during that phase of operation), but a high number of threads can be helpful
to speed up the initial data gathering step from the EPrints server.

To save a report of the articles sent to archiving services, you can use the
option -r (/r on Windows) followed by a file name.

Note that there is a lag between when web archives such as Internet Archive
receive a URL submission and when a saved copy is made available from the
archive.  (In the case of Internet Archive, it is 3-10 hours.)  If you cannot
find a given EPrints page in an archive shortly after running eprints2archives,
it may be because not enough time has passed -- try again later.

Return values
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This program exits with a return code of 0 if no problems are encountered.
It returns a nonzero value otherwise, following conventions used in shells
such as bash which only understand return code values of 0 to 255. The
following table lists the possible return values:

    0 = success -- program completed normally
    1 = no network detected -- cannot proceed
    2 = encountered a bad or missing value for an option
    3 = file error -- encountered a problem with a file
    4 = the user interrupted the program's execution
    5 = an exception or fatal error occurred

Other command-line arguments
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

eprints2archives will print messages as it works. To limit the messages
to warnings and errors only, use the option -q (or /q on Windows). Also,
output is color-coded by default unless the -C option (or /C on Windows) is
given; this option can be helpful if the color control signals create
problems for your terminal emulator.

If given the -@ argument (/@ on Windows), this program will output a detailed
trace of what it is doing, and will also drop into a debugger upon the
occurrence of any errors. The debug trace will be written to the given
destination, which can be a dash character (-) to indicate console output, or
a file path.

If given the -V option (/V on Windows), this program will print the version
and other information, and exit without doing anything else.
