# eprints2archives itself does not need the following, but Rich imports it,
# and for reasons I haven't figured out it is not installed by pip when it
# installs Rich during the creation of our pyz executables.  That causes
# our pyz executables to fail at run time.  So, let's import it ourselves.

typing_extensions >= 4.2.0
